Functional vs. OO - Common Data Structures
=============

Since I'm working on functional programming, I wanted to build and compare some common data structures in **Ruby** and **Scheme**.  

Why Scheme?
_____________

**Scheme** seemed as good a functional language as any to dive into functional programming, and there are some sweet 80s video lectures from MIT available online.

For more on Scheme, check out [MIT OCW - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/)

Why Ruby?
_____________

**Ruby** is clearly object-oriented, but it clearly was influenced by Lisp (of which Scheme is a dialect).  It's much more feature-rich compared to Scheme, and I enjoy comparing features which I essentially have to build in Scheme to functions available in the Ruby standard library.
